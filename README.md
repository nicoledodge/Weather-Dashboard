# About the App

TravelBuddy: Travel Planning and Inspiration

Our project team was tasked with tackling a real-world problem or need by creating an application. Our application helps travelers with trip planning and inspiration by giving them access to search cities worldwide and access data such as weather forecasts and events for their chosen dates. This task will allow us to increase our collaboration skills, gain exposure to server-side APIs, and experience things we may run into as we venture out in the world as new developers.

# User Story

```md
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

# Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
